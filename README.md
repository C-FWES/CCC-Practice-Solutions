# CCC-Practice-Solutions
Some solutions to senior and junior past contest problems for the Canadian Computing Challenge in Java. 

Note that some of these solutions will not work correctly in the CCC grader. The grader contains many incorrect test cases and these solutions have been locally verified to be correct based on the downloadable test cases.

Did one of my Java solutions help you out today? Would you mind dropping off some Basic Attention Tokens? I am a Brave verified creator and would greatly appreciate BAT donations, and anything helps for things like saving money for university. For those who don't know, BAT is a online token that Brave users can earn through viewing certain promoted advertisements on a variety of websites. It costs nothing to obtain and nothing comes out of your pocket to donate. Thanks!
